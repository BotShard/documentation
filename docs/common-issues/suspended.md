# Server Suspended

To prevent your free-tier Discord bot from being suspended or deleted, it is necessary to log in to the [dashboard](dashboard.botshard.com) **every 7 days**.

If you **fail** to do so, your bot will be suspended after 7 days and **deleted** after 15 days. In case your server is suspended, you can reactivate it via the [dashboard](https://dashboard.botshard.com/).

This practice is implemented for our free tier to manage the limited space, which can become cluttered with hundreds of unused Discord bot containers.
